            <h3>Our POS Projects</h3>
            <p class="desktop-view">Our POS projects, initially developed under the ownership of GNS Software Development, also owned by Garry N. Salunga, underwent a transition due to the temporary closure of GNS Software. Recognizing the value and potential of the projects, we decided to reopen it under a new entity.</p>

            <p class="desktop-view">Consequently, the project is now jointly owned and operated by Software G Development & Digital Printing Services in collaboration with former stakeholder from GNS Software Development.</p>

            <p class="desktop-view">This strategic move allows us to continue the development and provision of POS solutions while leveraging the expertise and resources of both entities. By combining forces, we aim to enhance the project's offerings, expand its reach, and provide comprehensive services to our clients under anew brand name.</p>
                
            <p class="desktop-view">While the ownership structure has evolved, our commitment to delivering high-quality POS solutions remains unwavering. We are excited about the opportunities this collaboration brings and look forward to serving our clients with enhanced capabilities and a renewed sense of dedication.</p>
